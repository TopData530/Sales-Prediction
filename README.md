# Sales-Prediction

Author: Eric Saechao

Business problem: To predict the sales of items that sold the most and the average of sales by each outlet type in dataset
### Data: Data retrieved from csv file with sales from outlets and various detail of items in dataset

## Methods
* Data preprocessed to get ready for machine learning
* Data models being trained into different regression models for variations
* Data is shown through visual interpretation of data
## Results
### Most items sold in dataset

This visual presentation represents which items are in dataset and how many of them sold
### Outlet type average sales

This visual graph represents the outlet types with highest average sales
## Model
The model used for the data was a Decision Tree regression. This model is reliable for preciting continuous value

The most important metric used is comparing the models and checking results to see which model is better suited for testing the data

Determining the accuracy as well as using models such as Decision Tree helps narrow down the root cause of a problem

## Recommendations
I recommend using the preprocess step to prepare data for modeling. This helps get data ready for training and determine what kind of prediction is needed. Then we can apply the right regression model to solve the problem.
